access rightscale server IPs from alfred


workflow is at "out" directory

other files are whats in the workflow

USAGE:
?ip-install username password (for rightscale)
?ip name_to_search
?ip-clear cleans the cache

IMPORTANT!: The first time you run this and every time after ?ip-clear will take some time to finish.
I recommend letting it run the full time until it is done.
